Greetings all.

I'm a computer hobbyist looking for a job involving computers. I currently work on updating my manuals and posting them on github. I got some knowledge from many technologies used, in fact too wide range of tools for memorizing by heart. That's why so many personal manuals. While bad at reading, I like to learn by doing, and thinking. Studying all sorts of weird things is what I daily do.

My career moves:
I've been an IT specialist for a year and I just quit my job. Gathering all info that I could, I'm ready to move on. Cyber Security is close to my heart. Possibly because I don't know the area well enough. Now trending AI-<anything> is a path that is also tempting. I have a feeling that a big part of the field will be regulated away from the normal user in the next few years. I want to learn it before this happens. I have a background as a phone repair-guy, but almost no SW knowledge in that area. It's a good thing phones these days use Android so an everyday dude gets a possibility to study them also.

Plan of learning:
Absolutely no plans. I never had any. Things are just intresting on a wide scale and I'm surfing in the sea of data. While I try to keep some of my projects private at least until I feel comfortable in publishing them, I shall have a lot of unfinished stuff made available. This is for showcasing at least something. For now the things I do are more of a personal journey so there is no pressure getting things done. I will be looking to some collaboration projects once I get the base of my profile in place. Somehow I have the need to make my TV do things that it normally wouldn't.

I have a file that lists some of my experience on my own projects, but it's missing. Wide range of computer stuff and game stuff is in the file.

I do my best to generate a timeline of self development when doing all sorts of tasks. Failed attempts on easy tasks will be included (not all). Usually still, the hero manages to overcome the difficulties.
